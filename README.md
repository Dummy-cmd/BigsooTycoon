#BigsooTycoon

Previous work dating back to June 2024.
The current owner of the game is not the same as before because the project was abandoned at some point...

Note: I coded everything by myself, so if there are scripts that are very hard to read, it's because I wasn't paying much attention to that since I was working alone. The game is mostly coded in OOP.

Frameworks used: Trove, Knit, Promise, Concur, Option, Signal, Maid, Zone, TopBarPlus, Web
